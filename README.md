# starting-flutter
Starting in flutter dev
This flutter project was only made in two days.
Completely new to flutter. While I have learned quite a lot in these days, I had
no time to complete it(uni, internship...). I managed to do some
of the GUI. No clean architecture is presented here, I watched some videos and learned of it, even started,
but when I saw I had no time I simply made a small demo, starting with the GUI. I also connected Firebase firestore
without using it. The article objects provided are minimal without all the features it could have(photos etc). Business and
data layers are completely omitted because of the time.

This is not  an ended project and I could complete it with some more days. 
Waiting for the feedback. Enjoy the app(xd).
